# LF AI & Data Related Logos and Artwork 
In this repo, we provide artwork in standard formats for the LF AI & Data projects and programs. We prepare artwork in 3 formats (PNG/SVG/AI), 3 layouts -- horizontal (also known as landscape format), stacked (which is closer to square), and icon (which does not include the name and is square), and 3 versions (color/black/white). So, that's at least 27 versions of most logos.
